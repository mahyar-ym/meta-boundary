Adding the boundary layer to your build
=================================================
Assuming the boundary layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the boundary layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-boundary \
    "



Allowing commercial license 
=====================================
Modify the local config file (located at build/conf/local.conf) to
allow acces to the commercial license

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial"



Using developement packages (if needed)
=============================================
Modify the local config file (located at build/conf/local.conf) to 
use developement packages

EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES += "dev-pkgs"
