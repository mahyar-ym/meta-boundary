Adding the boundary layer to your build
=================================================

Assuming the boundary layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the boundary layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-boundary \
    "


Allowing commercial license (for opencv) 
=====================================
Modify the local config file (located at build/conf/local.conf) to
allow acces to the commercial license

LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial"
